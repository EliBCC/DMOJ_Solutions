##[Mocking SpongeBob](https://dmoj.ca/problem/mockingspongebob)
This problem is a string-manipulation challenge. The input contains a string, and the output must be the same string, but with the capitalization of each letter alternating.
This solution was written in Python in 2016.

##[Infinity](https://dmoj.ca/problem/infinity)
This problem is an integer overflow challenge. The input contains two very large numbers in hexidecimal, and the program must be able to determine if the sum of these numbers will overflow an integer.
This solution was written in C in 2016.

##[Streetcars](https://dmoj.ca/problem/dmopc14c6p3)
This problem is a challenge in recursion. The input represents the number of passangers entering or leaving a streetcar, and the program must determine the difference in the number of streetcars needed if high-capacity streetcars are used versus low capacity streetcars.
This solution was written in Java in 2016.
